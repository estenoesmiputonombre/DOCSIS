## DOCSIS Background

### DOCSIS 1.0

Gave us standards-based interoperability, which means "certified" __Cable Modems__ from multiple vendors work with
"qualified" __Cable Modem Termination Systems__ (CMTS) from multiple vendors.

- DOCSIS UpStream -> One upstream channel, typically __1.6 MHz__ or __3.2 MHz__ bandwidth. (from 5 MHz to 42 MHz)
- DOCSIS DownStream -> One 6MHz bandwidth downstream channel, 64- or 256-QAM. (from 88 MHz to 860MHz)
